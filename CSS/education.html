    <div class="exp">I have some experience in coding and technology. Most of that experience has come from CyberPatriot and the 
        one coding class I took in highschool, however I have been interested in this for several years now. I look 
        forward to learning more and honing my skills.</div>
    <div class="ment">My most exciting achievement so far is a bit odd. It’s the fact that I have figured out how
         to accept myself. Being trans and depressed for many years, I have had to put a lot of work into my sense
          of self-worth and I am finally learning to love myself.</div>
    <div class="plans">When I finish Array’s school, I have two main plans. One is to publish one of the books I 
        am currently working on. The other is to save up and hopefully be able to buy a house with my fiance in the next 
        few years.</div>
